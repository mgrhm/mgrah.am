Mike Graham loves gundogs but doesn't like hunting or shooting.
His Springer Spaniel comes from a thoroughbred working line,
but has been utterly spoiled and is now just healthy and happy.
He has two cats but hasn't been able to train them.
He's reasonably sure that they've trained him.

He's mostly vegetarian,
but eats the occasional Big Mac.
It's complicated.
Not really;
they just taste really good.

He drinks tea
(strong,
lots of milk,
no sugar),
but doesn't drink coffee.
One of the great disappointments of his life
is that coffee _smells_ so good,
but the taste doesn't live up to the aroma.
He thinks this is one of the universe's cruellest tricks.

If you're looking to hire Mike,
or just want an overview of his working life,
you can get that on
[his LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-graham/).
He's really smart and hard-working,
and would make an excellent hire.
You'd definitely secure your bonus this year if you brought him on board.

Mike Graham doesn't like writing about himself in the third person.
You can
[email Mike](mailto:hello@mgrah.am)
if there's anything else you'd like to know,
and he promises to write back in first-person.
